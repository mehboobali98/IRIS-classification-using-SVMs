# IRIS Plant classification using Support Vector Machines

## Problem Statement

## Data Set

The dataset is made of examples of irises, each represented with a feature vector of dimension 4.
The examples belong to one of 3 categories (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The feature vectors
contain the width and length of the sepal and of the petals.

### Data Set Characteristics:

- Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)
- Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
- Attribute Information:
  - sepal length in cm
  - sepal width in cm
  - petal length in cm
  - petal width in cm
  - class:
    - Iris-Setosa
    - Iris-Versicolour
    - Iris-Virginica

## Implementation

## Using K-Fold Cross Validation and GridSearch for hyper-parameter tuning
